            <p>Under Section 12A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, non-profit organizations like charitable trusts, welfare societies, Section-8 Companies, NGOs, religious institutions, etc. are entitled to tax exemptions on their surplus income. This tax relief was introduced, keeping in consideration that non-profit entities work for social welfare and not for generating profit.</p>
            <p>NGOs have multiple options to select the form of constitution, like trust, society and section 8 company. In order to claim exemptions under section 11 & 12 of Income Tax Act, 1961, it is mandatory for all NGOs to get registration under section 12A of the act.</p>
            <p>Section 80G of Income Tax Act provides benefits to the donor of an NGO, whereas Section 12A Registration will provide benefits to an NGO to get an organization income exempted from Income Tax.</p>
