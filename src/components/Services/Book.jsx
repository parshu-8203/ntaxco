            <p><b>Bookkeeping</b> is the recording of financial transactions, and is part of the process of accounting in business and other organizations. It involves preparing source documents for all transactions, operations and other events of a business on day to day basis.</p>
            <p><b>Accounting</b> is the process of summarizing, interpreting, and communicating financial transactions which were classified in the ledger account.</p>
            <p>Bookkeeping and accounting are two functions which are extremely important for every business organization. In the simplest of terms, bookkeeping is responsible for the recording of financial transactions whereas accounting is responsible for interpreting, classifying, analyzing, reporting, and summarizing the financial data.</p>
            <h3 class="mb-2">Differences between Bookkeeping & Accounting</h3>
            <p>Bookkeeping and accounting may appear to be the same profession to an untrained eye. This is because both accounting and bookkeeping deal with financial data, require basic accounting knowledge, and classify and generate reports using the financial transactions. At the same time, both these processes are inherently different and have their own sets of advantages.</p>
