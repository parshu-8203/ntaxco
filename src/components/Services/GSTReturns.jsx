        A GST return is a document or file containing the details of all revenue
        from sales and output GST thereon and all GST Purchases including input
        GST thereon which a GST Dealer is required to file with the Goods and
        Services Tax Authorities/Department. We can say that the GST Return
        includes the details such as Purchases, Sales, Output Tax and Input Tax.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under GST, a regular taxpayer needs to furnish monthly returns and one
        annual return. There are separate returns for a taxpayer registered
        under the composition scheme, non-resident taxpayer, taxpayer registered
        as an Input Service Distributor, a person liable to deduct or collect
        the tax (TDS/TCS), a person granted Unique Identification Number. It is
        important to note that a taxpayer is NOT required to file all the types
        of returns. In fact, taxpayers are required to file returns depending on
        the activities they undertake.
      </p>
      <p>
        The GST Council has however recommended to ease the compliance
        requirements for small tax payers by allowing taxpayers with annual
        aggregate turnover up to Rs. 5 Crores to file details of outward
        supplies in FORM GSTR-1 on a quarterly basis and on monthly basis by
        taxpayers with annual aggregate turnover greater than Rs. 5 Crores.

          services of an ERP providers such as Tally, SAP, Oracle etc, there is

        Penalty for non-filing of GST Returns
      </h5>
      <p>
        In case a taxpayer does not file his/her return within the due dates,
        he/she shall have to pay a late fee of Rs. 200/- i.e. Rs.100/- for CGST
        and Rs.100/- for SGST per day (up to a maximum of Rs. 5,000/-) from the
        due date to the date when the returns are actually filed.
      </p>
      <p class="imp">
        From the month of October 2017 onwards, the GST Council has recommended
        that the amount of late fee payable by a taxpayer whose tax liability
        for that month is ‘NIL’ is Rs. 20/- per day (Rs. 10/- per day each under
        CGST & SGST Acts). However, if the tax liability for that month is not
        ‘NIL’, the amount of late fee is Rs 50/- per day (Rs. 25/- per day each
        under CGST & SGST Acts).
