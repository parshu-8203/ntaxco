        The Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is one of the business concepts
        in India, introduced by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA),
        Government of India during the year 2008. Unlike a partnership firm, a
        limited liability partnership has limited liability in which some or all
        partners will have the limited liability. It exhibits the elements of
        both partnership and company. In LLP, one partner is not responsible or
        liable for another partner's negligence or misconduct.
      </p>
      <p>
        The limited liability partnership is a legal entity and an alternative
        to corporate business form. It is liable to the extent of it's total
        assets whereas the partners liability is limited to the extent of their
        capital contribution. We can say LLP is an hybrid between a company and
        a partnership. LLP Registration is regulated by The Ministry of
        Corporate Affairs, Government of India. The governing law for the LLP is
        Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008. The LLP registration in India

        Benefits of a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) Registration
      </h3>
      <h5 class="text-primary">Limited Liability</h5>
      <p>
        The liability of the partners of the LLP is limited. The Designated
        Partners or Partners are not personally liable for the debts of the LLP.
        For example, when the LLP is in default of repayment of debt or loan,
        there is a protection to the personal assets of the Designated Partners
        or Partners. They can recover the loan amount only by selling the assets
        of the LLP. The lender will not involve in thier personal assets.
      </p>
      <h5 class="text-primary">Minimal Compliance</h5>
      <p>
        Limited Liability Partnership business is suitable for those who are
        looking for minimal statutory compliance. LLP exhibits the elements of
        both partnership and company. In LLP, one partner is not responsible or
        liable for another partner's negligence or misconduct. LLP is an hybrid
        between a company and a partnership. Most enterprenuers prefer LLP
        rather than a Partnership Firm.
      </p>
      <h5 class="text-primary">Auditor Appointment & Employee Attraction</h5>
      <p>
        An LLP, which is having turnover upto Rs. 40 lakhs or a Capital
        Contribution up to an amount of Rs. 25 lakhs is not required to appoint
        an Auditor. Talented employees show interest in LLP type of businesses
        instead of Partnership or Proprietorship firm. Employees of reputed LLPs
        can get loans from Banks easily at a less rate of interest.
      </p>
      <h5 class="text-primary">Designated Partner Dual Role</h5>
      <p>
        The Designated Partner of the Limited Liability Partnership can be the
        employee of the LLP. He can give his own premises on rent/lease to LLP
        and Collect rent from it, he can give loan to the LLP and can take loan
        from LLP, he can supply goods or services to the LLP and get
        consideration for that. LLP can raise unsecured loan without any
        restrictions as compared to a Company.
      </p>
      <h5 class="text-primary">Separate Entity</h5>
      <p>
        The Designated Partners of the of the Limited Liability Partnership may
        come and may go but an LLP may not go that means the Designated Partners
        are different and the LLP is different. Limited Liability Partnership
        can own assets on it own name and can sell. It can sue and can be sued
        in a court of law.
      </p>

        exit the LLP by simply signing a resignation letter. New Designated
        Partners may enter into LLP by signing the Limited Liability Partnership
